2. The main Aim behind this website is to eliminate any Middle Person between the Customer and the Seller. Emphasis is made on direct Transactions.
3. This will help the Localites connect to their nearby Stores more conveniently and also provide the Sellers a platform to sell their products.

IDEA EXPLANATION :
1. The brief idea is to create an easy to use and maintain e-commerce platform for local shops.
2. The local shops will be able to generate income online irrespective of any sort of lock down and can also compete with big e-commerce websites in the rising digital market.
3. The already existing solutions include platforms like shopmatic and instamojo, lack reach to the local markets and are not very easy to use for the shopkeepers and the customers.
